This project waswriting on Angular v8.0.1. and updaiting to Angular v11.1.0

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

##Needs optimization:
1) You need to switch from custom JS OwlCarusel to ngx-owl-carousel-o
2) Delete redundant library primeng and write all the functionality on Angularmaterial
3) Organize a good animation
